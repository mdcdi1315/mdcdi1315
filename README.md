## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am mdcdi1315, a continously learning developer creating cool projects in .NET and other environments in my free time (whenever I have such)

- ðŸ”­ I am currently developing the [Music Player On .NET](https://github.com/mdcdi1315/MP.DN-WINDOWS) app, that is another music player but targeting the modern .NET platform.
- I also know a lot about and can write `C` and this allows me to understand the .NET's P/Invoke feature, and use it effectively for my needs.
- Additionally, I have recently learned the `Java` programming environment. I intend at some time to write and a Minecraft Mod.
- I am working with digital audio a couple of years now. I know some stuff, however I need to expand this knowledge even more to unlock it's full possibilities.
- ðŸ¤” I would like in the future to improve my knowledge on web programming languages, mostly `JavaScript`, and work with the website concept.
- ðŸ‘¯ My goal is at some time in my life to work on multimedia in general.
- ðŸ’¬ For any questions regarding digital audio, `C#` , `.NET` , `C` and `Java`, do not hesitate to ask me privately at mds13363la@gmail.com!!! (although that I do not look it too often, I wish I had the time to check my e-mails more often)
